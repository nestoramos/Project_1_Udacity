# Seattle Airbnb
## _Libraries_
The followingt libreries have been used in this project:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model
- train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
- r2_score from sklearn.metrics
- mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics

## _Motivation_

This project has been created as an assignment of the Data Science's course from Udacity. I have choosen this dataset, because it was very interesting to know what the Airbnb market is like for Seattle. I made the assumption of being an investor who wants to enter this market and wants to know what it is like and how it behaves in order to be sure about my investment.

## _Files_

In this repository you can find two principal files, the file **listing** is the dataset to this project. The second one is **Project_1 Seattle listing** this is a Jupityer notebook, where you can find all code how the project has been working, the analysis and the results of the partitular questions.

## _Questions_

With this work, I wanted to answer the following questions:

- What is the most common property?
- How is the behavior of the unit price of that specific properties?
- What kind of things that properties should have?
- How could be a model to predict the unit price?

## _Results_

I have found the most common properties in the Seattle Market are Houses and Apartments, which don´t require a lot of rooms, beds and bathrooms, at most 2, but with only one of them is all right to this market.

About the price, there isn't much difference between the price of Houses and Apartments, in general, the unit price for houses is lower to the unit prices of apartments, but there ís only a small difference.

Unfortunately, the price prediction model failed to explain the price variations, much more work will need to be done to improve the model.I encourage you to take the challenge and improve the model of this work.
